summary


1. Basic Matrix Operations (Matrix class)
    - Matrix addition, subtraction, multiplication
    - Element-wise operations
    - Transpose operation
    - Matrix-vector multiplication
2. Matrix Decompositions
    - SVD (Singular Value Decomposition)
        - Decomposes matrix A into U∑Vᵀ
        - Used for PCA, dimensionality reduction
    - LU Decomposition with Pivoting
        - Decomposes matrix A into LU where L is lower triangular and U is upper triangular
        - Useful for solving linear systems
    - Gram-Schmidt Orthogonalization
        - Converts a set of vectors into orthogonal vectors
        - Used in QR decomposition
3. Special Matrix Types
    - Sparse Matrix (CSR format)
        - Efficient storage for matrices with many zeros
        - Specialized operations for sparse data
4. PCA (Principal Component Analysis)
    - Uses SVD for dimensionality reduction
        - Finds principal components of data
        - Computes explained variance ratios
